# Biome Tag Villagers

A mod that gives you control over how a villager will look in a biome via a set of tag lists!
---
A small server side mod that changes the current hard coded villager biomes to instead have the game read a set of tags
to determine what variant a villager will be in what biome.
If a biome is in multiple tag lists, it will randomize between the two.

### Configuration
The mod has only server side config in the format of tags. It adds 6 new tags for each villager type (eg. snowy, taiga,
savanna). This is just the standard minecraft biome tag.

The Example datapack can be found [here](https://github.com/theendercore/BiomeTagVillagers/tree/master/example).

### About this Fork

This is a fork of the original Biome Tag Villagers mod for Fabric to be run on NeoForge. It is for personal use and I
have no plans on releasing it myself on CurseForge, Modrinth, or any maven hoster. If you need to use this, feel free to build it
yourself.

Please support the original creator by going to their repository and trying out the Fabric version and/or donating to
their Ko-fi page.
